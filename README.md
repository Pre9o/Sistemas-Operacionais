# Sistemas Operacionais

This repository contains projects developed in C during the Operating Systems course in the fourth semester of the Computer Science program. The projects focus on key concepts of operating systems, such as process management, memory management, and synchronization mechanisms.

## Projects Included
- **Process Management**: Implementation of process creation and scheduling.
- **Memory Management**: Simulating memory allocation strategies (e.g., paging, segmentation).
- **File Systems**: Basic implementation of file system management concepts.
- **Synchronization**: Implementing synchronization primitives such as semaphores and mutexes.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Using pipes, shared memory, and message queues to enable communication between processes.

## Repository Structure
- **/t0**: Contains the C source code for each project, organized in folders by topic.
- **/t1**: Contains the C source code for each project, organized in folders by topic.
- **/t2**: Contains the C source code for each project, organized in folders by topic.
- **/bin**: Compiled executables (if applicable).
- **/docs**: Documentation and reports on the projects (if applicable).

## Technologies
- Language: C
- Compiler: `gcc` or any C-compatible compiler
- Operating System: Linux (recommended for testing and execution)
